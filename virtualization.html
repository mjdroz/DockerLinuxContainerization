            <h1>Virtualization</h1>
            <h2>What is Virtualization? </h2>
            <p>Virtualization can refer to a variety of computing concepts, but it usually refers to running multiple
                operating systems on a single machine. While most computers only have one operating system installed,
                virtualization software allows a computer to run several operating systems at the same time. </p>
            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <p>A Windows computer with VMware Workstation installed can run Linux within the Windows interface.
                Similarly, a Macintosh computer can use Parallels Desktop to run Windows within Mac OS X. When another
                operating system (OS) is running on top of the main system, it is called a "virtual machine." This is
                because it acts like a typical computer but is actually running on top of another operating system. </p>
            <h2>Why do we use it? </h2>
            <p>Virtualization can help you shift your IT focus from managing boxes to improving the services you provide
                to the organization. If you are managing multiple servers and desktops, virtualization can help you
                to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Save money. Companies often run just one application per server because they don’t want to risk the
                    possibility that one application will crash and bring down another on the same machine. Estimates
                    indicate that most x86 servers are running at an average of only 10 to 15 percent of total capacity.
                    With virtualization, you can turn a single purpose server into a multi-tasking one and turn multiple
                    servers into a computing pool that can adapt more flexibly to changing workloads.
                </li>
                <li>Save energy. Businesses spend a lot of money powering unused server capacity. Virtualization reduces
                    the number of physical servers, reducing the energy required to power and cool them.
                </li>
                <li>Save time. With fewer servers, you can spend less time on the manual tasks required for server
                    maintenance. On the flip side, pooling many storage devices into a single virtual storage device,
                    you can perform tasks such as backup, archiving and recovery more easily and more quickly. It’s also
                    much faster to deploy a virtual machine than it is to deploy a new physical server.
                </li>
                <li>Reduce desktop management headaches. Managing, securing and upgrading desktops and notebooks can be
                    a hassle. Desktop virtualization solutions let you manage user desktops centrally, making it easier
                    to keep desktops updated and secure.
                </li>
