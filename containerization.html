            <h1>Containerization</h1>
            <h4>What is Containerization?</h4>
            <p>
                Containerization is the process of encapsulating and packaging up software code into “containers” that
                are given instructions to be able to run that code. Containers are the run environments for that
                software code. They can be compared to something portable like CDs because they can be easily used and
                accessed from any computing environment with little to no problems.
            </p>
            <h4>Example of Containerization</h4>
            <p>
                Containerization can be used anywhere and everywhere because of the little amount of memory that it
                uses, compared to virtualization. One use can be taking legacy applications and splitting them up into
                multiple containers. Doing this can make patching the application easier and more efficient in the long
                run.
            </p>
            <h4>Why do we use it?</h4>
            <p>
                We use containerization because it provides a plethora of advantages to developers when compared to
                virtualization.
                Some of these advantages are:
            <ul>
                <li><strong> Portability: </strong> Containers take software and make it an executable package that can
                    be downloaded and
                    used on any computer system, platform, or cloud. This is because containers are not dependent on the
                    host operating system (OS) or the tied to it.
                </li>
                <li><strong> Speed: </strong> Since containers are not dependent on a host OS, servers that run your
                    containers can save
                    time by not having to boot a separate OS. This is because containers run on local machines OS
                    kernel.
                </li>
                <li><strong> Fault Isolation: </strong> Each container is running separately from other containers. This
                    means that the
                    failure of
                    one container will not prevent the other containers from running. This also allows for development
                    teams to resolve issues with on container without having to shutdown the other containers that are
                    already running.
                </li>
                <li><strong> Efficiency: </strong> Since containers are using the host machine's OS kernel, there is a
                    substantial amount
                    of containers that can run on the same computing power as a single VM. In turn, this allows for more
                    programs and applications to be running.
                </li>
                <li><strong> Ease of Management: </strong> When managing the software within containers, it is easy to
                    push updates and
                    add more features because each container is not dependent on the others in order to run. This can
                    help when dealing with a large scale project that is using multiple containers to provide a service.
                </li>
                <li><strong> Security: </strong> As mentioned before, containers run separately from each other. This
                    helps with security
                    because if a malicious software was to make its way into the application it would only be able to
                    spread as far as the container that it was able to gain access to.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </p>
